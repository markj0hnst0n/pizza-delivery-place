|-----------|----------------------|
| Database stopped working due to information in one of the fields not fitting the data model | Ran python3 manage.py flush to delete all information in database |
| Error message of "'decimal.Decimal' object is not iterable" being returned when trying to use context processor to add up cart item total | There was a return statement in my function in contexts.py which meant the contexts where not being rendered correctly.  Cart total now works correctly.
| Quantity increase and decrease buttons were not disabling below 1 and above 99 as per js. | The classes which the js used to identify the buttons were named as the wrong variable names.
| Remove button not working on cart page. | JQuery version being used did not have the correct POST functionality and there were indentation errors in the remove from cart view.  I was also using square brackets as opposed to normal brackets in the view to reomve the item from cart.
